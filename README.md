# Part Of Speech tagger

This part of speech (POS) tagger labels each word in a sentence with its part of speech (noun, verb, etc.).

It utilizes a [Hidden Markov model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) approach. The program trues to infer the POS (state) of each word based on the observed word and transitions between words.
